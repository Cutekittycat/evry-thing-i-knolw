        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I am Daniel and I'll talk to u about my favourite animal as u know I wrote about my favourite youtuber and now its my favourite animal lets get started.My favourite animal is a arctic fox and a wolf. I love arctic foxes cause thier fur is white as snow and they are very rare. You can only find arctic foxes where its soooo cold like antartica , greenland and the north pole they are so cute as well. Now time for wolf they are cool and awesome and very visious band if u did not know there are 3 different tires of wolfs.; First tire is normal wolfs so like betas and normal. they are quite slow and bad at hunting and there always lisning to the alphas.Second tire is the Alpha they are strong , fast and they can smell you a mile away. Last but not least is the ultima the ultima is super duper fast and strong and they are the most dangerous wolfs upon earth and there the difanition of CHAOS and DISTRUCTION they will kill anything easy as pie they can even kill the king of the jungle they are soo killing dangerous but thank goodness they do not exist yet well they did but now we dont know if they exist or not. Thank u for reading and have a good day</p>
